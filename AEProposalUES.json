    "RaptorEagleSummary": "<p>The US Fish and Wildlife Service recommends a 10-mile buffer of projects that require surveys designed to assess Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) use of the project site and surrounding areas. Surveys will occur between January and February and March and April. Nests determined to be active in the first or second survey require a third survey to determine success/productivity. Thus, with each survey period, the survey effort decreases; the first is the most labor-intensive, and the final is the least.</p><p>Prior to conducting the nest surveys, we will use Geographical Information System (GIS) technology and Google Earth imagery to map potential raptor nesting habitat (i.e., cliffs) within the 10-mile buffer of the proposed facility.</p><p>At the initiation of the first survey, the 10-mile buffer area will be visually reviewed to confirm the GIS screening. If areas were incorrectly identified (either as or as not potential Golden Eagle nesting habitat), the correction will be made in the GIS mapping, and these areas will be either included or excluded in the area surveyed.</p><p>Areas offering suitable Golden Eagle nesting habitat will be examined using pedestrian surveys near the base of these structures or from roads that afford views of these areas. When topography does not allow for close examination, these areas will be searched using binoculars and spotting scopes from vantage points that allow unobstructed views of the potential nesting habitat.</p><p>When a nest is located (active or inactive), data will be collected using a mobile data collection application that contains the information requested in the BLM Raptor Nest Structure and Eyrie Inventory Form (02-28-06). Data includes but is not limited to the UTM location of each nest (in UTM NAD 83 Zone 11), nest structure type, location on the cliff face, aspect of the cliff, etc. To collect the UTM coordinate for nest sites located away from the surveyor, the surveyor will project the location of the nest with a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) unit by identifying the distance (using a laser range finder) and direction (compass degrees) that the nest is from the surveyor’s known UTM location. All nest sites found will be identified to species (when possible), and digital photos of each nest site will be taken. The age (adult, juvenile) of all raptors observed during the surveys will be recorded. Golden Eagle nest surveys will be conducted by or under the supervision of biologists experienced with Raptor nest surveys.</p><p>Ground-based surveys have advantages over helicopter use because they are less disturbing to nesting birds and bighorn sheep.</p><p>Golden Eagle nest site attendance will be defined based on adult activity (i.e., nest building, courtship flights/feeding, agitated or territorial behavior directed at an intruder [observer] within the nest vicinity, or continued adult presence in or near an existing nest as determined by observation). A lack of these or other behavioral clues will make a nest inactive. Nest site occupancy will be based on the presence of an attending adult Golden Eagle or the presence of eggs/young.</p><p>In addition to Golden Eagle nests, biologists will also record the locations of other raptors and corvid (Common Raven [Corvus corax] and American Crow [Corvus brachyrhynchos]) nests. Though corvids are not classified as raptors, they ecologically fill the same niche and select nest sites like raptors (Craighead and Craighead 1956, Boarman and Heinrich 1999). The location of corvid nests will be recorded because of the propensity of raptors to reuse old corvid nests and to take over corvid nests (Stokes and Stokes 1996, Wheeler 2003).</p><p>UES will prepare a report draft within one month of the final survey for review/comment. Two rounds of review/comment are anticipated. The report will include an executive summary, a brief description of the site, habitat types (i.e., nesting/foraging) within the survey area, survey results, a discussion of what potential impacts may exist for active Golden Eagle nests based on distance from disturbance, nest site aspect, line of sight, etc., an aerial photograph and topographic map identifying final survey transects, and lastly an aerial photograph and topographic map identifying nest locations, activity, and species. Field data forms will be provided as an appendix to the report. Should any agency require a different methodology, such as use of drones or helicopters, an amended Work Plan will be submitted for your review and approval prior to beginning the investigations.</p>",

    "CactiYuccaSummary": "<p>The proposed alignments traverse lands under the jurisdiction of the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which has determined that cacti and yucca need to be accounted for within the project right of way to determine correct mitigations for those plants. Plants in permanent disturbance areas can be sold to the public or paid for with a fee, and plants in the temporary disturbance area will be transplanted to a nursery site within the alignment and then, when construction is completed, relocated back to further restoration efforts.</p><p>UES will survey the project alignment and mark each cactus and yucca identified. Each cactus or yucca will have a digital datasheet created that records its precise location, species, height estimation, plant health condition, and if multiple plants are in the same geographic area. Cacti and yucca will also be flagged to mark progress and aid in later identification. Once the survey is completed, the data will be overlaid in GIS on the project alignment to determine the number of each species within the temporary and permanent disturbance areas. A summary of the survey and these findings will be submitted to the client, along with a shapefile containing all collected data. Having actual plant counts will help BLM and the client determine the applicable mitigation and fees (e.g., plant sale, salvage, no action, etc.).</p>",
